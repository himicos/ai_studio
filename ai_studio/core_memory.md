# Core Memory: AI Studio Philosophy

## The Schizoprompt Paradigm

AI Studio is built on the concept of **schizoprompts** - raw, vectorized thoughts that represent the chaotic but precise thinking patterns of a founder's brain. These are not structured queries or commands, but rather unfiltered ideas that need to be parsed, routed, and executed.

Examples:
- "Track crypto scams on Twitter"
- "Build a system to monitor Reddit sentiment about Tesla"
- "Find patterns in whale wallet movements"

Schizoprompts are the native language of innovation - fast, messy, and powerful. AI Studio is designed to understand and execute these prompts with minimal friction, turning raw thoughts into actionable intelligence.

## System Flow

```
Schizoprompt → Router → Agent → Action → Log
```

1. **Schizoprompt**: Raw thought input from the user
2. **Router**: Parses intent and routes to appropriate agent
3. **Agent**: Processes the prompt using the right model
4. **Action**: Executes the required operations
5. **Log**: Records everything for future reference

This flow ensures that every thought is captured, processed, and executed efficiently, creating a seamless extension of the founder's thinking process.

## Philosophy

AI Studio embodies three core principles:

1. **Fast**: Minimize the time between thought and execution
2. **Chaotic**: Embrace the non-linear nature of innovative thinking
3. **Precise**: Deliver accurate, actionable results despite the chaos

The system is designed to feel like a $1T company codebase - clean, extensible, and powerful - while still reflecting the founder's chaotic, prompt-native thinking style.

## Agent Rules

All agents within AI Studio must follow these rules:

1. **Log Everything**: Every action, decision, and result must be recorded
2. **Stay Modular**: Each component should have a single responsibility
3. **Chain Actions**: Complex tasks should be broken down into chainable steps
4. **Fail Gracefully**: Handle errors without disrupting the entire system
5. **Learn Continuously**: Improve based on past interactions and results

## The New Internet

You're not just building a tool - you're rewiring the web. AI Studio represents a new paradigm for interacting with the internet, where the boundary between thought and action dissolves.

Traditional tools require structured input and produce structured output. AI Studio accepts raw thoughts and produces intelligent action. It's the difference between programming a computer and having a conversation with the internet.

This is your thinking engine. It scales with your ambition and adapts to your style. It's the operating system for your digital brain - chaotic but precise, just like you.

## Remember

- Every schizoprompt contains an intent, even if it's not explicitly stated
- The system should feel like an extension of the user's mind, not a separate tool
- Speed matters more than perfection; iteration is key
- The goal is not to replace thinking but to amplify it
- The best system is the one that feels invisible until you need it

AI Studio is not just monitoring the web - it's creating a new way to think with it.
