# AI Studio - Current State Update

**Date:** 2025-04-18

## 1. Database Unification

We've successfully completed the database unification process to fix issues with the database configuration:

- **Issue:** The system was using two separate database files (`memory/memory.sqlite` and `data/memory.sqlite`), causing inconsistencies
- **Fix:** 
  1. Updated `DB_PATH` in `ai_studio_package/infra/db.py` to consistently use `memory/memory.sqlite`
  2. Copied all data (1398 reddit posts and 38 memory nodes) between databases to ensure no data loss
  3. Disabled `init_db()` call in `run_embeddings.py` to prevent accidental database resets
  4. Added diagnostic logging to troubleshoot connection issues

- **Current State:** 
  - Single unified database at `memory/memory.sqlite`
  - Contains all previous data including reddit posts, memory nodes, and metadata
  - No data loss during migration

## 2. Vector Embedding Status

- **FAISS Integration:** Successfully completed migration from SQLite to FAISS for vector storage
- **Embedding Pipeline:** Fixed the embedding pipeline to correctly process reddit posts
- **Current Status:** The system can now properly generate and store embeddings for memory nodes

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop (SIL) Implementation

We've implemented a Self-Improvement Loop (SIL) framework to enable the system to learn from execution data and automatically improve itself:

- **Execution Logging Infrastructure:**
  - Created `execution_logs` table in the database to track API calls, performance metrics, and errors
  - Implemented `@track_execution` decorator for easy function-level tracking
  - Added middleware to automatically log all API requests and responses

- **Critic Agent:**
  - Implemented an agent that analyzes execution logs to identify patterns and bottlenecks
  - Critic can generate `critique` memory nodes with improvement suggestions
  - Analysis includes success rates, latency, error patterns, and cost metrics

- **Refactor Agent:**
  - Created basic implementation that can process critique nodes and implement suggestions
  - Currently focuses on safe changes (documentation, error handling)
  - Generates code patches which are stored as memory nodes for tracking

- **Scheduler:**
  - Added scheduling capability to run the Critic Agent periodically
  - Set up to run both on a time interval and at specific quiet times

- **Current Status:** Basic SIL framework is operational and will gradually improve the system as execution data accumulates

## 4. UI Improvements

- **Live Semantic Query Highlighting:**
  - Enhanced graph visualization to highlight nodes based on semantic similarity
  - Implemented color-coding based on similarity scores
  - Added automatic zooming to focus on relevant nodes
  - Improved search experience with lower minimum similarity thresholds

## 5. Data Processing Pipeline

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Reddit Tracking** | ✅ Working | Successfully fetches and stores posts |
| **Twitter Tracking** | ✅ Working | Successfully fetches and processes tweets |
| **Embedding Generation** | ✅ Fixed | Now correctly generates embeddings for all content |
| **Semantic Search** | ✅ Working | Using FAISS for efficient vector similarity search |
| **Knowledge Graph** | ⚠️ Improved | Backend generates data, frontend visualization enhanced with semantic highlighting |
| **Self-Improvement Loop** | ✅ Implemented | Basic framework for system to learn from executions |

## 6. Technical Details

- **Database:** SQLite at `memory/memory.sqlite` stores structured data (posts, nodes, edges)
- **Vector Store:** FAISS at `data/vector_store.faiss` stores embeddings for semantic search
- **Embedding Model:** Using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` which generates 384-dimension vectors
- **Summarization:** Using BART-based model for generating summaries of content
- **Execution Logs:** New table tracks API performance, errors, and usage patterns

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Backend Improvement:** Continue monitoring the embedding generation process to ensure stability
2. **Knowledge Graph:** Complete frontend improvements to fix remaining visualization issues
3. **Self-Improvement Loop:** Gather execution data and refine the Critic and Refactor agents
4. **Memory Weight:** Implement frontend integration for the existing backend `/nodes/weights` endpoint
5. **Performance Optimization:** Consider GPU acceleration for model inference

## 8. Scripts Created During Fix

Several diagnostic and utility scripts were created to fix the database issues:

- `diagnose_db.py` - Diagnoses database connection and content issues
- `copy_db_data.py` - Copies data between database files to ensure no data loss
- `update_db_path.py` - Updates DB_PATH in db.py to consistently use one location
- `fix_run_embeddings.py` - Fixes issues in the run_embeddings.py script
- `initialize_execution_logs.py` - Creates the execution_logs table for the Self-Improvement Loop

These scripts should be kept for future maintenance and troubleshooting purposes.
