    "content": "Just been looking on about this VET crytpo for last 1 hour.\n\n\nSaw it's graph and it went to 0.2$ in 2021 but after that never went above 0.05$ and is currently at 0.02$\n\nAsked Deepseek and Chatgpt about it and they told almost similar stuff that the crypto has a purpose and just needs more contacts and partnerships for it's price to go up although not sure if that's gonna happen or not. Deepseek told me one more thing but that's because I asked it a different question. Asked it that how Chinese crypto affect VET coin and it told since china has strictly banned crypto so VET has very low chances of goingup however there are rumors that china might remove the bans or be less strict or something and we could potentially see a rise then. What are your thoughts on it?\n\nOnly had 16$ left after losing my money on meme coins haha but that's my fault for listening to friends.\n\nSo invested my last 16$ into VET.\n\nHoping that this coin goes boom",
