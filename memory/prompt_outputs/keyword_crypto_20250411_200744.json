    "content": "Now that the market took a little dip (ik not much) but i figured id start with $250 of bitcoin. I sold all of my various crypto when bitcoin got over 100k and am stuck with like $50 worth of matic and atom. Should i go the basic route and stick to btc and eth or branch out to sol ltc avalanche etc? Budget is ab $700 a month. Is see sol is around half what it peaked at as well so definitely going with that to. Thats it. 500Character extension:qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq",
