  "summary": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has proposed a reconfiguration of the AllCoreDevs (ACD) meetings to better align with Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) roadmap. He suggests separating the planning and execution phases. The ACD should focus more on scoping future forks, while existing testing calls should be emphasized as the primary platform for discussing current forks. This approach aims to streamline the development process and enhance the efficiency of Ethereum's progress.",
