  "summary": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, shared his current privacy roadmap on Twitter. He notes that his approach involves fewer changes at the Layer 1 (L1) level, which also means its effects are more limited. He encourages readers to explore the details on the Ethereum Magicians forum, suggesting there is more in-depth discussion available there. This roadmap is part of ongoing conversations about enhancing privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem.",
