    "title": "[IPO] AIRO IPO: Aerospace &amp; Defense Play at $14\u2013$16? Too Good to Be True?",
    "content": "Just saw this pop up on Robinhood under IPO Access: AIRO is offering shares at $14\u2013$16. From what I\u2019ve gathered, they\u2019re an aerospace and national defense company\u2014so I\u2019m guessing they might be working in tech-enabled aviation, drones, or defense logistics?\n\nNot gonna lie, that price point caught my eye. Aerospace + defense has been heating up lately, and the sector usually sees strong government contracts, but I haven\u2019t been able to find much info yet on financials, backlog, or big-name partners.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering before jumping in:\n\t\u2022\tIs this a serious growth play, or a speculative moonshot?\n\t\u2022\tAre there any known government contracts or tech partnerships?\n\t\u2022\tWhat\u2019s their revenue model \u2014 commercial, defense, or hybrid?\n\t\u2022\tDoes anyone know if this is more like Anduril, AeroVironment, or just another small-cap SPAC in disguise?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to overhype it, but $14\u2013$16 entry for a legit defense-tech company feels like it could either be a steal or a trap. Not financial advice\u2014just curious what the due diligence crowd thinks.",
