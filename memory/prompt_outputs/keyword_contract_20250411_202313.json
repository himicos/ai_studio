    "content": "Well boys, I\u2019m a gambler, but with an MBA in Finance and Economics, which makes me a dangerous retard. Like, I paid six figures to learn how to lose money more efficiently.\n\nSo yesterday, while drunk off six tequila sodas and 2.5 bad decisions, I had a vision from the stonk gods (or maybe it was just the hangover kicking in early). I slapped $20k on 150 SPY $525 puts that expired today. Full send. Balls deep. No lube. Just vibes.\n\nWoke up this morning, still half-pickled from last night, saw my account was at $40k. Doubled up. Cool. But my brain\u2014operating at a solid 12% capacity\u2014said, \u201cNice tendies, let\u2019s not be greedy.\u201d So I sold.\n\nThen I blacked out again metaphorically this time\u2014l and didn\u2019t check the markets until mid-day.\n\nOpened my app\u2026\n\nAnd those same contracts?\n\nWould\u2019ve been worth $250k.\nThat\u2019s right. A quarter-freaking-million dollars. From a $20k YOLO. I could\u2019ve walked into Gucci and asked for the deed. I could\u2019ve adopted a baby dolphin. I could\u2019ve bought 500,000 McChickens and still had cash for sauce.\n\nBut no.\n\nI locked in my peasant gains and left a private island worth of tendies on the table.\n\nMoral of the story?\nBeing a responsible trader is for cowards.\nRisk management is a scam.\nAnd most importantly, never trade sober.\n\nA win is a win\u2014but this one stinks worse than my ex\u2019s crypto picks.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve just thrown the $40k into $50 call options on SQQQ that expire next Friday. We ride again, baby.\nPray for me.\n\nGod bless America, and God bless leveraged options.\n\n",
