# Debugging Notes - 2025-04-13

## Summary

This document outlines the debugging process undertaken on April 13th, 2025, to resolve issues preventing the Twitter Agent panel from loading and functioning correctly in the Spyderweb frontend application.

## Initial Problem: Persistent Frontend Build Error

Upon attempting to load the Twitter Agent panel (either via direct import or lazy loading), the application consistently crashed with a misleading JavaScript error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/panels/agents/twitter/FeedList.tsx' does not provide an export named 'default' (at TwitterAgentPanel.tsx:12:8)
```

This error was misleading because:
1.  `FeedList.tsx` correctly used named exports.
2.  `TwitterAgentPanel.tsx` correctly imported `FeedList` using named imports.
3.  Line 12 of `TwitterAgentPanel.tsx` did not involve `FeedList`.

## Debugging Steps & Findings (Frontend)

Numerous steps were taken to isolate the cause of the frontend build error:

1.  **Import/Export Verification:** Confirmed correct usage of named vs. default exports for all involved components (`TwitterAgentPanel`, `FeedList`, `FilterPanel`, `TrackedUserBadge`/`Icon`, `UserSearch`). Switched between named and default exports for `TwitterAgentPanel`.
2.  **Cache Cleaning:** Performed multiple levels of cache clearing, including:
    *   Browser hard refresh & cache clear.
    *   Deleting the `.vite/` directory.
    *   Deleting `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` followed by `npm install` (This ultimately resolved the build error).
3.  **Lazy Loading:** Toggled `React.lazy` on and off for `TwitterAgentPanel`, adjusting the import strategy accordingly.
4.  **Component Simplification / Incremental Rebuild:**
    *   Systematically commented out child component imports (`FeedList`, `FilterPanel`, etc.) within `TwitterAgentPanel`.
    *   Systematically commented out library imports (`framer-motion`, `lodash/debounce`, etc.).
    *   Systematically commented out internal logic (`useEffect`, callback bodies) within `TwitterAgentPanel`.
    *   Reduced `TwitterAgentPanel` and `FeedList` to minimal structural placeholders.
    *   **Successful Approach:** After a full clean install resolved the build error, we successfully rebuilt `TwitterAgentPanel` by adding back complexity layer by layer (State -> Callback Shells -> Effect Shells -> Callback Logic -> Effect Logic -> JSX). The build remained stable throughout this process.
5.  **Component Renaming:** Renamed `TrackedUserBadge.tsx` -> `TrackedUserIcon.tsx` to force Vite to treat it as a new module.
6.  **Component Deletion/Recreation:** Completely removed all Twitter agent frontend files and references, verified stability, then recreated the files.
7.  **Vite Plugin Check:** Temporarily disabled the `lovable-tagger` development plugin.

**Conclusion (Frontend Build Error):** The persistent `SyntaxError` was likely caused by a deeply corrupted Vite build cache or state, possibly interacting with the `lovable-tagger` plugin. A **full clean install** (including `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`) was necessary to resolve it. The incremental rebuild strategy proved effective in verifying the component's internal logic once the build system was stable.

## Current Problem: Backend Unresponsive (Port Binding Error)

After resolving the frontend build error, API calls from the frontend to the backend (`/api/twitter-agent/...`) were observed hanging indefinitely in the browser's Network tab.

**Debugging Steps & Findings (Backend):**

1.  **Network Analysis:** Confirmed requests were pending, not failing immediately.
2.  **Route Simplification:** Simplified the `/api/twitter-agent/tracking_status` route to return a hardcoded response, bypassing database and tracker logic. Requests *still* hung.
3.  **Direct Backend Access:** Attempting to access the simplified route directly (`http://localhost:8000/...`) failed, indicating the server process wasn't responding.
4.  **Backend Log Analysis:** Identified repeated `[Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind on address ('0.0.0.0', 8000)` errors immediately after `Application startup complete.`, indicating the port was already in use, preventing the server from listening.
5.  **Process Killing:** Attempts to find and kill the process using port 8000 (PID 1732 initially identified) using `tasklist`, `netstat`, `taskkill`, and `Stop-Process` were inconsistent, suggesting the process might be terminating itself or `netstat` information was lagging.
6.  **Uvicorn Auto-Reload:** Disabled Uvicorn's `reload=True` feature in `main.py` to prevent potential issues related to unclean shutdowns during development.

**Conclusion (Backend):** The backend server (Uvicorn/FastAPI) is currently **unable to start successfully** because **port 8000 is persistently blocked** by another process, preventing it from binding and listening for incoming requests. This is the root cause of the hanging API calls.

## Current State & Next Steps (As of 2025-04-13 End of Day)

*   **Frontend:**
    *   The persistent `SyntaxError` build issue is resolved.
    *   The Twitter agent components (`TwitterAgentPanel`, `FeedList`, `FilterPanel`, `TrackedUserIcon`, `UserSearch`) have been recreated and integrated.
    *   The UI loads but shows infinite loading states because backend calls hang.
    *   `React.lazy` is currently *disabled* for `TwitterAgentPanel`.
    *   The `lovable-tagger` Vite plugin is currently *disabled*.
*   **Backend:**
    *   Fails to start due to `[Errno 10048]` port binding error on port 8000.
    *   Uvicorn auto-reload is *disabled* (`reload=False`).
    *   `TwitterTracker` initialization in `main.py` `startup_event` is *commented out* for debugging.
    *   The `/api/twitter-agent/tracking_status` route logic is *simplified* to return a hardcoded value.

**Plan for Tomorrow:**

1.  **Resolve Port 8000 Binding Issue:**
    *   Thoroughly investigate which process is holding port 8000 (re-run `netstat -ano | findstr "8000"`, check Task Manager).
    *   Forcefully terminate the blocking process.
    *   If the issue persists, **restart the computer** to clear any OS-level locks.
2.  **Verify Backend Startup:** Start the backend (`python main.py`) and confirm it runs *without* the `[Errno 10048]` error and responds to direct browser access (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/docs`).
3.  **Restore Backend Logic:**
    *   Uncomment the original logic in the `/api/twitter-agent/tracking_status` route.
    *   Uncomment the `TwitterTracker()` initialization in the `main.py` `startup_event`.
    *   Test if the backend still starts and responds correctly after these restorations.
4.  **Test Full Application:**
    *   Start the frontend (`npm run dev`).
    *   Verify the Twitter panel loads and API calls complete successfully.
    *   Debug any *runtime* errors encountered during interaction.
5.  **(Optional) Re-enable Optimizations:**
    *   Consider re-enabling `React.lazy` for `TwitterAgentPanel` and test stability.
    *   Consider re-enabling the `lovable-tagger` plugin and test stability.

## Recommended Approach for Future Agents (e.g., Reddit)

The incremental rebuild approach used for `TwitterAgentPanel` proved effective after resolving the build system instability:
1.  Start with a minimal component shell.
2.  Add state (`useState`).
3.  Add callback shells (`useCallback`).
4.  Add effect shells (`useEffect`).
5.  Add logic inside callbacks one by one.
6.  Add logic inside effects one by one.
7.  Restore full JSX.
8.  Test frequently at each step, monitoring both frontend and backend consoles.
