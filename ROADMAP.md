# SpyderWeb AI Studio: Visual Memory System Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our strategic plan for enhancing the visual memory system in SpyderWeb AI Studio, focusing on high-impact, low-effort improvements that will exponentially increase the platform's capabilities.

## Core Philosophy

**100x Impact with 1x Effort**: Leverage existing vector memory, semantic search, and agent infrastructure to create intelligent visualizations that transform how users interact with knowledge.

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancements

#### 1. Live Semantic Query Highlighting
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Low (1x)
- **Impact**: 30x UX, 10x search capability
- **Description**: Highlight relevant nodes and paths based on cosine similarity when users enter a question or term
- **Implementation**:
  - Add query input field to graph container
  - Use existing `searchMemoryNodes()` function with similarity threshold
  - Apply color gradient to nodes based on similarity score
  - Highlight connecting paths between highly similar nodes
  - Add visual legend for similarity scale

#### 2. Memory Weight / Attention Encoding
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Low (1x)
- **Impact**: 25x visibility into system focus
- **Description**: Vary node/edge size or opacity based on importance, recent activation, or frequency of use
- **Implementation**:
  - Extend memory node schema with `activation_score` and `last_accessed` fields
  - Create node sizing function based on these metrics
  - Implement decay function for activation over time
  - Add toggle for different sizing metrics (frequency, recency, importance)

### Phase 2: Interaction & Debugging

#### 3. Agent Trace Mode (Replay Reasoning)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Low (1x)
- **Impact**: 20x debugging/understanding
- **Description**: Visually replay the path of nodes an agent followed or created during a task
- **Implementation**:
  - Create trace logger middleware for memory access
  - Store sequence of node accesses with timestamps
  - Add timeline slider component to replay traces
  - Implement animation of highlighted paths with sequenced timing
  - Add export option for trace data

#### 4. Prompt-Context Linking
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Low (1x)
- **Impact**: 15x prompt quality improvement
- **Description**: Visualize which memory nodes are injected into which prompts as context
- **Implementation**:
  - Store prompt metadata with references to memory nodes used
  - Create bidirectional links in graph between prompts and context nodes
  - Add special visual treatment for prompt nodes
  - Implement filter to show only context used in specific prompts
  - Create hover state showing prompt text using the node

### Phase 3: Organization & Navigation

#### 5. Modular Tag Clustering
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Low (1x)
- **Impact**: 25x clarity and organization
- **Description**: Group nodes by user-defined or auto-tagged topics for better organization
- **Implementation**:
  - Use existing keyword extraction to generate cluster tags
  - Implement force-directed clustering algorithm based on tags
  - Add UI controls for manual tag creation and assignment
  - Create collapsible/expandable tag groups
  - Add tag-based filtering options

#### 6. Memory Mode Toggle
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Low (1x)
- **Impact**: 15x insight through multiple perspectives
- **Description**: Toggle between different visualization modes (time-based, importance, project-specific)
- **Implementation**:
  - Create mode selector in graph controls
  - Implement chronological layout algorithm
  - Add importance-weighted layout option
  - Create project/workspace filter with saved configurations
  - Ensure smooth transitions between modes

### Phase 4: Advanced Interactions

#### 7. Actionable Nodes
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Medium (2x)
- **Impact**: 40x operational speed
- **Description**: Add context menu to nodes with actions like "Summarize," "Generate post," "Find similar," "Execute agent"
- **Implementation**:
  - Create right-click context menu component
  - Define standard action set for all node types
  - Implement node-type-specific actions
  - Connect actions to existing API endpoints
  - Add visual feedback for action execution
  - Create action history panel

#### 8. Graph AI Copilot
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Medium (2x)
- **Impact**: 100x interface power
- **Description**: Integrated AI assistant that works directly within the graph visualization
- **Implementation**:
  - Add chat input component to graph panel
  - Connect to existing LLM integration
  - Implement response visualization that highlights relevant nodes
  - Create ability for copilot to generate new nodes and connections
  - Add option to accept/reject proposed changes
  - Implement specialized graph-based prompts

## Implementation Strategy

### Quick Wins (Next 2 Weeks)
