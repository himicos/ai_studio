# Twitter Agent Debugging Summary - 2025-04-15

## Goal Achieved: Feed Display Functional!

Today's session focused primarily on diagnosing and resolving the persistent issue preventing scraped tweets from appearing in the frontend feed, building upon the previous day's work which stabilized the core add/delete functionality.

## Progress & Fixes Implemented:

1.  **Scraping Timeout Resolved:**
    *   **Problem:** `BrowserManager` timed out waiting for tweet elements on Nitter.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Confirmed `MiraiScanner.py` worked on the same machine without proxies, indicating an issue with `BrowserManager`'s configuration or Nitter instance choice, not IP blocking. Compared implementations.
    *   **Fixes:**
        *   Integrated advanced anti-detection Selenium options from `MiraiScanner` into `BrowserManager.setup_driver`.
        *   Removed proxy usage as it wasn't the root cause and `MiraiScanner` didn't use it.
        *   Removed Nitter instance rotation and hardcoded `nitter.net` to match the working scanner.
        *   Corrected `WebDriverWait` target from `div.timeline` to `div.timeline-item`.
        *   Added `execute_script` call to hide `navigator.webdriver`.
    *   **Result:** Scraping successfully finds and processes tweet elements without timing out.

2.  **Date/Stats Parsing Refined:**
    *   **Problem:** Feed showed incorrect dates ("55 years ago") and zero stats.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Initial parsing logic in `BrowserManager` was flawed (using general parser for dates, placeholders for stats).
    *   **Fixes:**
        *   Implemented specific date parsing using `datetime.strptime` and `pytz` for the Nitter date format.
        *   Added basic stats parsing logic based on icon classes (identifies correct spans, needs refinement for values).
        *   Ensured `process_tweets` used the correct ISO date format string.
        *   Fixed Pydantic `ValidationError` by making `date_posted` optional in the `TweetResponse` model.
    *   **Result:** Dates and basic stats (like likes) are now parsed and displayed correctly.

3.  **Database Locking Resolved:**
    *   **Problem:** Backend became unresponsive ("stacking") during tweet processing due to `database is locked` errors.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Frequent individual DB connections/writes within the `process_tweets` loop caused contention, likely exacerbated by synchronous embedding generation calls.
    *   **Fixes:**
        *   Refactored `process_tweets` to use **batch inserts** (`executemany`) for both `memory_nodes` and `tracked_tweets` within a single transaction after the loop.
        *   Implemented an `asyncio.Lock` (`_scan_lock`) in `TwitterTracker.scan` to prevent concurrent scan executions (manual vs. background loop).
        *   Temporarily **disabled** the synchronous call to `generate_embedding_for_node` within `create_memory_node` to eliminate it as a blocking factor.
    *   **Result:** Batch inserts complete successfully without locking errors, and the backend remains responsive.

4.  **Empty Content Issue Resolved:**
    *   **Problem:** Even after fixing parsing and DB inserts, tweet content was empty (`""`) in the database and frontend feed.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Traced the data flow. Confirmed content was parsed correctly in `BrowserManager` but was being accessed using the wrong dictionary key (`text` instead of `content`) within `process_tweets`.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected the key access to `tweet.get('content', '')` in `process_tweets`.
    *   **Result:** Tweet content is now correctly stored and displayed in the frontend feed!

## Current Status:

*   **Core Functionality:** Add User, Delete User, Run Scan, Start/Stop Tracking triggers, and Feed Display are all functional.
*   **UI Updates:** Add/Delete actions correctly update the user list automatically. Feed updates after a scan + `fetchFeed`.
*   **Scraping:** Successfully retrieves tweets from `nitter.net`, parsing ID, Content, Date, and basic Stats.
*   **Database:** Batch inserts prevent locking; data is stored correctly.
*   **Known Issues:**
    *   Stats parsing in `BrowserManager` needs refinement to accurately extract counts.
    *   Embedding generation is currently disabled.
    *   Remaining linter errors in `TwitterAgentPanel.tsx`.
    *   `UserSearch` component remains disabled.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Refine Stats Parsing:** Update the `get_user_tweets` function in `BrowserManager.py` to accurately parse the numbers for replies, retweets, likes, etc., from the `span.tweet-stat` elements based on the text content next to the icons.
2.  **Test Start/Stop Tracking:** Thoroughly test the "Start Tracking" and "Stop Tracking" buttons. Verify:
    *   The background loop runs scans periodically when started.
    *   The loop completely stops when "Stop Tracking" is clicked (check backend logs for scan activity cessation).
    *   The UI button state (`isTracking`) remains synchronized with the backend state.
3.  **Address Linter Errors:** Fix the remaining TypeScript errors in `TwitterAgentPanel.tsx` (likely related to unused imports or minor type issues now that `Tweet`/`SortOption` are fixed).
4.  **Re-evaluate Embedding:** Decide on a strategy for re-enabling embedding generation (e.g., async task, background queue) so it doesn't block the main loop, and implement it in `db_enhanced.py` / `create_memory_node`.
5.  **(Optional) Re-enable `UserSearch`:** If needed, investigate and fix the `onUserAdded` prop issue within `UserSearch.tsx` before re-enabling it in `TwitterAgentPanel.tsx`.
6.  **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining temporary comments or console logs.

I will now create the markdown file `2025-04-15_progress_notes.md`.Apologies again, I seem to have forgotten I cannot create files directly.

Please create a new file named `2025-04-15_progress_notes.md` in your workspace root (`ai_studio_package/`) and paste the following content into it:
